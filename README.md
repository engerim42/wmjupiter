# wmJupiter

(c) 2001 Thomas Kuiper <tkuiper@inxsoft.net>

Please e-mail me if you got questions or ideas for this program.

It shows you the actual distance of Jupiter in AE and when
the red spot crosses. The four Gallileo Moons are displayed too but
only when they are near the planet (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Calisto).

The applet space is too small to display all moons at the same time but
a future version might be able to zoom in/out.

Type "make" to build it and then ./wmJupiter <spot lat>, e.g. 80
The position of the red spot changes on the surface so you need
to change that value within few months or so. The current position
can be found on the internet. It was 80 deg. as of 11th Jan 2002.
